      "passage": "PASSAGE 2:\n\nClimate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time. The Earth's climate has changed throughout history, but the current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95% probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century.\n\nThe primary cause of climate change is the greenhouse effect. Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. This is a good thing because it keeps our planet warm enough for life to exist. However, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, have significantly increased the concentration of these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This enhanced greenhouse effect is causing the Earth's average temperature to rise, a phenomenon known as global warming.\n\nThe consequences of climate change are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, more frequent and intense extreme weather events such as hurricanes and droughts, melting glaciers and polar ice, and shifts in wildlife populations and habitats. These changes threaten not only the natural environment but also human health, agriculture, water supplies, and infrastructure.\n\nAddressing climate change requires a two-pronged approach: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation involves reducing the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, either by reducing sources of these gases or enhancing the 'sinks' that accumulate and store them. This can be achieved by transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and protecting forests. Adaptation involves adjusting to actual or expected future climate to minimize harm. This includes building sea walls, developing drought-resistant crops, and improving early warning systems for extreme weather.\n\nWhile the challenge is immense, there is growing international cooperation to combat climate change. The Paris Agreement, adopted by nearly every nation in 2015, aims to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and to limit the global temperature increase this century. Individual actions, such as reducing energy consumption and supporting sustainable practices, also play a crucial role in the collective effort to address this global issue.",
